  - Conducted literature reviews on liquid crystal, compressive sensing and spectrometers
	- Designed and optimized meta-atoms for high reconstruction performance by numerical simulations on Ansys Lumerial FDTD
  - Proposed a double-layer filter with the liquid crystal layer sandwiched between two metasurfaces, which can be electrically tuned to obtain multiple spectral responses for hyperspectral imaging
  - Examined factors affecting the image reconstruction performance


- Circular-polarization-splitting Axicon Based on Metasurface}
  - Southeast University, China <p align="right">Supervisor:Zheng-gao Dong</p>
	- Gained foundational knowledge in nano-optics and computational electromagnetics and conducted literature reviews on metamaterials
	- Performed numerical simulations on CST Studio Suite to evaluate the performance of different meta-atoms
	- Designed circular-polarization-splitting meta-axicons based on C-shaped and V-shaped meta-atoms, and developed MATLAB code to automate the construction of the designed metasurface with any wanted deflection angle and scale
	- Simulated and measured its performance on CST and optimized its structure for better results
